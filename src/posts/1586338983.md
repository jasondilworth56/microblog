After a ridiculously stressful few weeks, I’m finally slowing down a bit today. 

We’ve been in self isolation (which isn’t that different to lockdown) for 13 days because both our kids have had coronavirus symptoms. We’re not convinced it was coronavirus, but at this time, even a standard edition kid fever hits differently. 

Being a parent is hard work right now and I’ve certainly not experienced this level of anxiety for a lot of years.

I’ve also been deep in one of the largest client projects I’ve ever done. The peak of which happened while we were in this panic state about our children’s health. That’s been a real test, but it’s also given me a buffer which I’m incredibly privileged to have. I’ve got so much empathy for my fellow freelancer chums going through this time right now.

It’s all looking up though. I launched the pre-orders of my new Eleventy course yesterday which have been _flying_ off the shelves. The support from folks has legit made me do a little cry over the last 24 hours. Y’all are amazing and you’re helping me to dedicate more resources to the end-product.

So, back to today: I’m just gonna muck around building some bits for Piccalilli and generally chilling out. It feels good starting my day at 10:43am. I’m back to normality a little bit.
