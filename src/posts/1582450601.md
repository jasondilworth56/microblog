I binged “Don't F**k With Cats: Hunting an Internet Killer” on Netflix last night and I’m still angry.

It’s a fascinating story, but there was too much footage of animal and human cruelty that really, didn’t improve the story. The horror could have mostly been implied, instead IMO.

It’s a very difficult watch, but also very interesting.
