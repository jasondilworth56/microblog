I’ve gone back to using a paper bullet journal. 

The Notion setup I had was cool, but I just wasn’t using it, and being the obsessive organiser that I am: I was getting very stressed.

I think the main issue was speed. Bullet journaling is supposed to be _fast_, but even though I had templates and formulas: Notion was just not fast enough. This just stopped me keeping on top of things. 

This is no shade on Notion, FWIW. I fucking love that app and it runs so much stuff for me. I just don’t think it’s right for me and bullet journaling.
