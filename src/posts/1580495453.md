I can’t stress enough how literally *any* real success I’ve had in this industry has had a direct link to my blog: <https://hankchizljaw.com>

Coding and design ability have for sure been important, but nothing quite like writing.

To be clear, I’m talking about **my** blog, too. Not Medium or DEV or whatever—my blog. Content elsewhere is ephemeral. Content on my blog is permanent.

I made [Hylia](https://hylia.website/) to make it as easy as possible for people to own their own content for that reason.
