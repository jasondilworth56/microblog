🔥📷 Static design tool pro tip.

Create an “Annotation” component that you can use as a sticky note to provide context for certain design elements. It helps not just developers, but also others on your team (even in my team of 1).

![Sticky note component reads 'A user needs to have at least 3 pieces selected in order to progress, so we show a “skeleton” item to signify that and also explain it in 
plain text.'](https://hankchizljaw.imgix.net/annotation-in-figma.jpg?auto=format&q=60)
