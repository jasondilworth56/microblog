This Google Fonts subsetting thing is cool. Append your url with `&text=` with the characters you want. 

Tests:

1. With subsetting (~21k): <https://cdpn.io/andybelldesign/debug/95773da82c7eaf769a6a9fb86c563c9d>
2. Without subsetting (~11k): <https://cdpn.io/andybelldesign/debug/b993258f2a59ce956eae99d94fe48ab5>

I only use Playfair for headings on the new [piccalilli](https://piccalilli) site and Iâ€™ll still serve the font locally, but generating it like this is hella useful.

Nice work, fonts team! 

***

On the WIP piccalilli site with Playfair Display (900) and Courier Prime (400):

1. Before subsetting: 55kb
2. After subsetting: 17kb

Fonts served locally still, but generated with Google Fonts instead of Font Squirrel.

I could almost fit one React in that space.
