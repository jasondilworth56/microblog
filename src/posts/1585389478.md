Pro tip: American Pancakes don’t require many ingredients and are easy to make. 

Perfect quarantine cooking.

All you need: 

135g/4¾oz plain flour
1 tsp baking powder
½ tsp salt
2 tbsp caster sugar (normal is fine)
130ml/4½fl oz milk
1 large egg

*Method*

Mix the dry ingredients (sift if you have a sieve).

Beat the egg and add the milk separately. Then add the dry ingredients.

Let it rest. I leave it for about 10-15 mins but the more it rests, the more it’ll bubble up.

The batter should be thick! 

Get a ladle (or just pour a small circle) of batter in the pan. 

When it bubbles at the top, flip it until it’s nice and golden brown in both sides.

You’re done. Get some, butter, berries and maple syrup on those mofos.
