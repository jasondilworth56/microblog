⏱ Some time tracking stats. You can read why I’m doing it [here](https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/tracking-my-time/).

I spent 16 hours doing client production this week with only 1 hour spent in client meetings (hell yeh).

For side projects, I spent just under 5 hours doing stuff for them (mainly [Front-End Challenges Club](https://front-end-challenges.club/)).

I spent 3 hours and 45 minutes writing blog posts and finally, 4 hours and 30 minutes doing general business admin and email.

Around 30 hours all together, but I’ve not been hugely disciplined this week with it. I’ll try to do better next week.
