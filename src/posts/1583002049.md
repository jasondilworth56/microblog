I have an obsessive condition about cleanliness and hand washing. It’s been the case for probably about 10 years but has gotten much worse over the last 5 years.

It’s something that’s super hard and stressful, because it niggles at me, as with any obsessive condition. When I’m stressed, anxious or in an unfamiliar place, it gets much worse too.

The extra kicker is because I’m like this, I get super bad skin on my hands. That’s a bastard, that is.

All of this recent talk about washing hands makes me feel a bit better though. Coronavirus is horrific, but if it improves people’s hygiene, at least there is a micron of positivity. 

This is what stresses me out the most: people’s awful hygiene. When I’m in a public toilet, I’m a wreck because there’s always a dude who either doesn’t wash there hands or just rinses them. Then they touch the door handle and that’s me done for the day: obsessing over how dirty my hands are, even though I washed them.

I’m not really sure where I’m going with this: I just thought I’d share to show solidarity with others like me. If you are like me, I’m sending hugs at this time ♥️
